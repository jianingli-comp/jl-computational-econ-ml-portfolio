# Computational Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my selected projects in:

- Distributed systems (Scala, Spark, GraphX)
- Machine learning and data processing
- Computational economics and simulations
- NLP and data analysis

The goal of this portfolio is to keep track of my technical work and support future Co-op and PhD applications.
